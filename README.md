# go-chunk (WIP)

A simple chunker interface. It is extracted from https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/ and the original author is [@whyrusleeping](https://github.com/whyrusleeping)

The idea of this `chunk` package is to define a common interface for all sorts of chunking algorithms. That way we can swap them in easily. Think of this as a companion to `io.Reader`.

TODO: "Chunker" or "Splitter" ? go-chunk or go-split?
